# Need Total?
## Description
This is used in relation to the [Slots](./Slots.md) category. The number you put in is the total the dice you insert needs to equal before the equipment will accept it.

If your item has a countdown, then the total is the total of the countdown! 

## Real World Example
Slots | NEED TOTAL? | Description
--- | --- | --- 
NORMAL\|NORMAL | 7 | The dice you insert need to equal 7 in total (e.g. A 3 and a 4 would be accepted, so would a 2 and a 5)
COUNTDOWN | 10 | The equipment will have a countdown of 10, this means you need to insert dice until the total is 10. Partially counted down equipment will have their countdowns persist between turns!

change_function

complicate - changes slots, chart below

change_power

doublerequirements - this makes sense, it turns a REQUIREX card into a REQUIREX|REQUIREX card

noeffect - this makes the card have no effect when weakened

removereusable - this makes reusable cards no longer reusable when weakened

decreaserange - this decreases the range of a MAXX or MINX card. a MAX4 will become MAX3 and a MIN3 will become MIN4

burnsparedice - this is only used on the "A Spare Dice" cards, and it (presumably) sets the spare die on fire so it costs 2 health to use

## Complicate
NORMAL -> MAX3

EVEN -> NEEDS6

ODD -> NEEDS5

MIN4 -> NEEDS6

MIN5 -> NEEDS6

MAX slots get halved (rounding up)
